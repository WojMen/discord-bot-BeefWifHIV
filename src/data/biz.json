In order to post on /biz/ you will now have to do one of the following:● Wait 15 minutes as a new user.● Verify your email address to post immediately.● Have a 4chan Pass.So for clarity, you will not have to verify your email address if you don't want to. If you are a new user, you can instead simply wait 15 minutes before posting. After the wait, you can post threads and replies as normal. If you've been a user of 4chan for more than 15 minutes, the process should be seamless for you. If you are a new 4chan user, then verifying your email address bypasses the wait.You will need to accept 4chan cookies for any of these methods to work. Also, as before, should you choose to verify your email we will not retain long-term records of your email address. After the verification email has been sent, your email address will be purged from our servers.",

These things are literally designed to suck cash out of the wallets of the terminally dumb.Honestly, I don’t even know why I bother posting here. In a few weeks, none of this will matter because once the devs and VCs take another peek under the hood of KNS, they’ll have a collective nerdgasm over what it’s actually solving.Even though the jannies make me want to pull my hair out, I feel this weird responsibility to toss you guys a bone. Why? Because I've been stacking W’s from this place since the ancient VeChain days, when dinosaurs traded JPEGs.Now, the Timeleap team? They’ve done literally zero marketing because they're giga autists. I swear, they’d rather solve puzzles than talk to people. But, once they get noticed at Devcon and get their moment in the spotlight, I’m out. Biztards will FOMO in when it hits 100m+, and I'll be watching with popcorn.One last time for the people in the back: It was on biz at sub 300k. It was on biz last year at sub 5m. It's on biz now at 27m. When it hits 500m+, I’m officially in the \"don’t give a single crap\" zone, and whatever cosmic debt I owe to the oldfags for making me rich will be settled.",

I will lose money with inflation-put money into saving account at the bank. not bad, because it allows you to withdraw money, you don't lock it for years. but interest you get is pretty low-governments bonds. How do they work? Do I have to buy new bonds or can I buy used bonds from someone? Where to buy bonds? If I buy bonds, is my money frozen for many years, or can I sell my bonds to someone? What bonds do you recommend, second world countries like Brazil, Russia, Hungary, Mexico, Thailand? Because bonds of rich countries pay nothing.-corporate bonds. I looked at them once but they seem to be shit, don't pay more than government bonds but are more likely to default.-buy house or flat. I don't have enough money to buy. And in some places housing prices are at peak, bubble, right now. Also, it takes long time to buy sell house.-gold, silver, oil, resources. I don't like them because they don't \"work\" like companies, they just stay and do nothing. However, they could be not a bad option when stock market is bad for next 10 years. However, gold just had large increase in price in the last year so I will not buy it because of this.-crypto and bitcoin. It's a scam and pure speculation. However, I could still play this speculation for short term. The problem is, bitcoin is at the peak price, it's in a bubble, it's very bad period to buy it.-make my business. I will but not now, you need a good plan and enough capital, good timing.-buy stock market but pick stocks that will have good returns even in a bad stock market for next 10 years. I will not do this because I don't have any ability to predict which stocks would do good over next 10 years in bad stock market and economy.1/2",

      "postMessage": "Welcome to the /XMR/ Monero General, dedicated to the discussion of the world's most widely adopted privacy coin.Monero payments are anonymous, low-fee by design and fully fungible, meaning users can send XMR globally without issue and receive XMR without having to worry about tainted coins. Battle-tested privacy tech (Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses and RingCT) ensures that critical TX data cannot be gleaned from the Monero blockchain. Thus by default, the TX history of all Monero users is kept hidden from the prying eyes of adversaries, with TXs being optionally transparent via the aid of a view key.Monero algorithmically ensures low TX fees by employing a dynamic (elastic) block size that can \"stretch\" to easily accommodate sudden TX spikes.Monero's bespoke mining algorithm, RandomX, is optimized for devices using general-purpose CPUs e.g. desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, keeping the barrier to entry low and ASICs out of the equation.Monero's tail emission - 0.6 XMR every block forever - financially incentives for-profit miners to keep mining, helping boost long-term network security. This constant linear inflation asymptotically trends to zero and is offset somewhat by a steady rate of coin loss.Monero has thus far proven to be the only altcoin capable of overcoming BTC's network effect by driving it out of the darknet economy BTC dominated for over 10 years. Monero is now also starting to overtake BTC in clearnet commerce as well. See below.If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.Comment too long.

      "postMessage": ">How to *safely* acquire, store and spend XMRAn optimal XMR user set-up involves 2 separate wallets: an offline cold wallet (savings account) and an online hot wallet (chequing account) for everyday spending. XMR amounts larger than a few hundred dollars worth should not be stored on a hot wallet for obvious reasons. So ideally, you'll want to direct all payments/donations to your cold wallet by default and then transfer smaller amounts over to your hot wallet as necessary.Relying on 3rd party hardware wallets comes with certain security caveats so they are not recommended. Instead, its surprisingly easy to engineer a very robust storage solution yourself using readily available hardware: a laptop and a smartphone.>LaptopThis will be running Featherwallet and must be *permanently* disabled from ever connecting to the internet again! That means physically removing the M.2 Bluetooth/Wi-Fi card and gumming up the ethernet port with superglue.OS should be Linux rather than Windows, preferably a Debian-based lightweight distro. Encrypting the relevant user directory with LUKS is recommended but not essential.It must have a functional webcam.Comment too long. Click here to view the full text.",

And anyway you shape it, there is always a Big Bad Wolf that is responsible for a problem and not the team, dev, coin, code, infrastructure, distribution, planning, liquidity, etc. However, the reality is something less appealing, but often necessary, it's the dev selling for neet bux, it's the team creating volume for listing, it's a sniper with centralized power manipulating an exit...you get the idea. I encourage you to look for The Big Bad Wolf in your next coin. You'll find him very soon. That said, Lily hits different 9I say that every time I know, but fr fr no cap this time, and on gawd playboi). There is a genuine feeling I get from the dev and the team in telegram. Shilling here is also quite dedicated and if you are not a tourist, then it should stick out like a golden nugget in a sea of turds. Passion, comitment, drive, grit, and creativity. Hard to fake. Not to say Lily doesn't have some troubling aspects. But I am pleased with how they have addressed them, for example, clearly explaining distribution. So enjoy this low-key, low IQ shill that pretends to be high IQ. (But fr fr watch out for The Big Bad Wolf in your projects). Thanks for coming to my blog!

      "postMessage": "Welcome to the /XMR/ Monero General, dedicated to the discussion of the world's most widely adopted privacy coin.Monero payments are anonymous, low-fee by design and fully fungible, meaning users can send XMR globally without issue and receive XMR without having to worry about tainted coins. Battle-tested privacy tech (Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses and RingCT) ensures that critical TX data cannot be gleaned from the Monero blockchain. Thus by default, the TX history of all Monero users is kept hidden from the prying eyes of adversaries, with TXs being optionally transparent via the aid of a view key.Monero algorithmically ensures low TX fees by employing a dynamic (elastic) block size that can \"stretch\" to easily accommodate sudden TX spikes.Monero's bespoke mining algorithm, RandomX, is optimized for devices using general-purpose CPUs e.g. desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, keeping the barrier to entry low and ASICs out of the equation.Monero's tail emission - 0.6 XMR every block forever - financially incentives for-profit miners to keep mining, helping boost long-term network security. This constant linear inflation asymptotically trends to zero and is offset somewhat by a steady rate of coin loss.Monero has thus far proven to be the only altcoin capable of overcoming BTC's network effect by driving it out of the darknet economy BTC dominated for over 10 years. Monero is now also starting to overtake BTC in clearnet commerce as well. See below.If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.Comment too long.

These things are literally designed to suck cash out of the wallets of the terminally dumb.Honestly, I don’t even know why I bother posting here. In a few weeks, none of this will matter because once the devs and VCs take another peek under the hood of KNS, they’ll have a collective nerdgasm over what it’s actually solving.Even though the jannies make me want to pull my hair out, I feel this weird responsibility to toss you guys a bone. Why? Because I've been stacking W’s from this place since the ancient VeChain days, when dinosaurs traded JPEGs.Now, the Timeleap team? They’ve done literally zero marketing because they're giga autists. I swear, they’d rather solve puzzles than talk to people. But, once they get noticed at Devcon and get their moment in the spotlight, I’m out. Biztards will FOMO in when it hits 100m+, and I'll be watching with popcorn.One last time for the people in the back: It was on biz at sub 300k. It was on biz last year at sub 5m. It's on biz now at 27m. When it hits 500m+, I’m officially in the \"don’t give a single crap\" zone, and whatever cosmic debt I owe to the oldfags for making me rich will be settled.",

I understand that different jurisdictions have different rules, and may have ID requirements for purchases above a limit. I also understand that there may be different rules for buying vs selling, but I've never sold any silver.Speaking to a LCS owner here in Alberta, he advised me that the Leaf government passed laws YEARS ago requiring the collection of personal information for all PM purchases. The law is on the books, but has not been \"enabled\" (proclaimed) yet, but can be activated anytime with no advance warning. Another thing people need to be aware of when buying from LCS are the \"follow home\" robbers. For those who haven't heard, criminals are staking out high end jewelery stores, then following customers who make large purchases to their residences and doing home invasion robberies. USA/Canada are turning into South Africa.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48a-8oSfpok [Open]The counter to this is to be aware of vehicles loitering near the LCS and to not drive straight home but to do some countersurveillance moves like overshooting your exit on the freeway and taking the next exit to loop back on the freeway and noting if anyone followed you. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XwG5MBDS3Xc [Open]",

Battle-tested privacy tech (Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses and RingCT) ensures that critical TX data cannot be gleaned from the Monero blockchain. Thus by default, the TX history of all Monero users is kept hidden from the prying eyes of adversaries, with TXs being optionally transparent via the aid of a view key.Monero algorithmically ensures low TX fees by employing a dynamic (elastic) block size that can \"stretch\" to easily accommodate sudden TX spikes.Monero's bespoke mining algorithm, RandomX, is optimized for devices using general-purpose CPUs e.g. desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, keeping the barrier to entry low and ASICs out of the equation.Monero's tail emission - 0.6 XMR every block forever - financially incentives for-profit miners to keep mining, helping boost long-term network security. This constant linear inflation asymptotically trends to zero and is offset somewhat by a steady rate of coin loss.Monero has thus far proven to be the only altcoin capable of overcoming BTC's network effect by driving it out of the darknet economy BTC dominated for over 10 years. Monero is now also starting to overtake BTC in clearnet commerce as well. See below.If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.Comment too long.

These things are literally designed to suck cash out of the wallets of the terminally dumb.Honestly, I don’t even know why I bother posting here. In a few weeks, none of this will matter because once the devs and VCs take another peek under the hood of KNS, they’ll have a collective nerdgasm over what it’s actually solving.Even though the jannies make me want to pull my hair out, I feel this weird responsibility to toss you guys a bone. Why? Because I've been stacking W’s from this place since the ancient VeChain days, when dinosaurs traded JPEGs.Now, the Timeleap team? They’ve done literally zero marketing because they're giga autists. I swear, they’d rather solve puzzles than talk to people. But, once they get noticed at Devcon and get their moment in the spotlight, I’m out. Biztards will FOMO in when it hits 100m+, and I'll be watching with popcorn.One last time for the people in the back: It was on biz at sub 300k. It was on biz last year at sub 5m. It's on biz now at 27m. When it hits 500m+, I’m officially in the \"don’t give a single crap\" zone, and whatever cosmic debt I owe to the oldfags for making me rich will be settled.",

      "postMessage": "Welcome to the /XMR/ Monero General, dedicated to the discussion of the world's most widely adopted privacy coin.Monero payments are anonymous, low-fee by design and fully fungible, meaning users can send XMR globally without issue and receive XMR without having to worry about tainted coins. Battle-tested privacy tech (Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses and RingCT) ensures that critical TX data cannot be gleaned from the Monero blockchain. Thus by default, the TX history of all Monero users is kept hidden from the prying eyes of adversaries, with TXs being optionally transparent via the aid of a view key.Monero algorithmically ensures low TX fees by employing a dynamic (elastic) block size that can \"stretch\" to easily accommodate sudden TX spikes.Monero's bespoke mining algorithm, RandomX, is optimized for devices using general-purpose CPUs e.g. desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, keeping the barrier to entry low and ASICs out of the equation.Monero's tail emission - 0.6 XMR every block forever - financially incentives for-profit miners to keep mining, helping boost long-term network security. This constant linear inflation asymptotically trends to zero and is offset somewhat by a steady rate of coin loss.Monero has thus far proven to be the only altcoin capable of overcoming BTC's network effect by driving it out of the darknet economy BTC dominated for over 10 years. Monero is now also starting to overtake BTC in clearnet commerce as well. See below.If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.Comment too long.

How do they work? Do I have to buy new bonds or can I buy used bonds from someone? Where to buy bonds? If I buy bonds, is my money frozen for many years, or can I sell my bonds to someone? What bonds do you recommend, second world countries like Brazil, Russia, Hungary, Mexico, Thailand? Because bonds of rich countries pay nothing.-corporate bonds. I looked at them once but they seem to be shit, don't pay more than government bonds but are more likely to default.-buy house or flat. I don't have enough money to buy. And in some places housing prices are at peak, bubble, right now. Also, it takes long time to buy sell house.-gold, silver, oil, resources. I don't like them because they don't \"work\" like companies, they just stay and do nothing. However, they could be not a bad option when stock market is bad for next 10 years. However, gold just had large increase in price in the last year so I will not buy it because of this.-crypto and bitcoin. It's a scam and pure speculation. However, I could still play this speculation for short term. The problem is, bitcoin is at the peak price, it's in a bubble, it's very bad period to buy it.-make my business. I will but not now, you need a good plan and enough capital, good timing.-buy stock market but pick stocks that will have good returns even in a bad stock market for next 10 years. I will not do this because I don't have any ability to predict which stocks would do good over next 10 years in bad stock market and economy.1/2",

That doesn't even mean 300 people hold the token since people usually hold multiple wallets.Furthermore, many of those holders hold much more than 1% of the token.I'm not making any of this up. You can verify it on a website like dextools.Now, what all this means is that the token can get rugged at literally any moment.Again, you have not made any actual gains unless you've sold.

      "postMessage": "Welcome to the /XMR/ Monero General, dedicated to the discussion of the world's most widely adopted privacy coin.Monero payments are anonymous, low-fee by design and fully fungible, meaning users can send XMR globally without issue and receive XMR without having to worry about tainted coins. Battle-tested privacy tech (Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses and RingCT) ensures that critical TX data cannot be gleaned from the Monero blockchain. Thus by default, the TX history of all Monero users is kept hidden from the prying eyes of adversaries, with TXs being optionally transparent via the aid of a view key.Monero algorithmically ensures low TX fees by employing a dynamic (elastic) block size that can \"stretch\" to easily accommodate sudden TX spikes.Monero's bespoke mining algorithm, RandomX, is optimized for devices using general-purpose CPUs e.g. desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, keeping the barrier to entry low and ASICs out of the equation.Monero's tail emission - 0.6 XMR every block forever - financially incentives for-profit miners to keep mining, helping boost long-term network security. This constant linear inflation asymptotically trends to zero and is offset somewhat by a steady rate of coin loss.Monero has thus far proven to be the only altcoin capable of overcoming BTC's network effect by driving it out of the darknet economy BTC dominated for over 10 years. Monero is now also starting to overtake BTC in clearnet commerce as well. See below.If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.Comment too long.

The modern challenges we face—climate change, economic inequality, and geopolitical conflict—are transnational in nature and require solutions that transcend nationalistic boundaries. A world without borders allows for more efficient cooperation, resource distribution, and human mobility, ultimately advancing our collective well-being.Furthermore, humanity stands to benefit under the guidance of a global elite—a cohort equipped with the knowledge, resources, and networked influence to make informed decisions on a global scale. Rather than fragmented governance that prioritizes national interests, a unified, well-coordinated leadership structure can address humanity’s greatest challenges with an equitable and scientifically grounded approach. Kamala Harris, with her forward-thinking vision, symbolizes the potential for this transformative shift, moving us toward a more cohesive, borderless world where humanity is no longer divided by artificial lines but united in purpose.",

      "postMessage": "Welcome to the /XMR/ Monero General, dedicated to the discussion of the world's most widely adopted privacy coin.Monero payments are anonymous, low-fee by design and fully fungible, meaning users can send XMR globally without issue and receive XMR without having to worry about tainted coins. Battle-tested privacy tech (Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses and RingCT) ensures that critical TX data cannot be gleaned from the Monero blockchain. Thus by default, the TX history of all Monero users is kept hidden from the prying eyes of adversaries, with TXs being optionally transparent via the aid of a view key.Monero algorithmically ensures low TX fees by employing a dynamic (elastic) block size that can \"stretch\" to easily accommodate sudden TX spikes.Monero's bespoke mining algorithm, RandomX, is optimized for devices using general-purpose CPUs e.g. desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, keeping the barrier to entry low and ASICs out of the equation.Monero's tail emission - 0.6 XMR every block forever - financially incentives for-profit miners to keep mining, helping boost long-term network security. This constant linear inflation asymptotically trends to zero and is offset somewhat by a steady rate of coin loss.Monero has thus far proven to be the only altcoin capable of overcoming BTC's network effect by driving it out of the darknet economy BTC dominated for over 10 years. Monero is now also starting to overtake BTC in clearnet commerce as well. See below.If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.Comment too long.

I will lose money with inflation-put money into saving account at the bank. not bad, because it allows you to withdraw money, you don't lock it for years. but interest you get is pretty low-governments bonds. How do they work? Do I have to buy new bonds or can I buy used bonds from someone? Where to buy bonds? If I buy bonds, is my money frozen for many years, or can I sell my bonds to someone? What bonds do you recommend, second world countries like Brazil, Russia, Hungary, Mexico, Thailand? Because bonds of rich countries pay nothing.-corporate bonds. I looked at them once but they seem to be shit, don't pay more than government bonds but are more likely to default.-buy house or flat. I don't have enough money to buy. And in some places housing prices are at peak, bubble, right now. Also, it takes long time to buy sell house.-gold, silver, oil, resources. I don't like them because they don't \"work\" like companies, they just stay and do nothing. However, they could be not a bad option when stock market is bad for next 10 years. However, gold just had large increase in price in the last year so I will not buy it because of this.-crypto and bitcoin. It's a scam and pure speculation. However, I could still play this speculation for short term. The problem is, bitcoin is at the peak price, it's in a bubble, it's very bad period to buy it.-make my business. I will but not now, you need a good plan and enough capital, good timing.-buy stock market but pick stocks that will have good returns even in a bad stock market for next 10 years. I will not do this because I don't have any ability to predict which stocks would do good over next 10 years in bad stock market and economy.1/2",

It's extremely bitcoin and meme centric this cycle, and the pumps just don't last nearly as long as they did in previous cycles. This is due to lack of liquidity and VC's being completely out of the game (due to high interest rates aka no free money anymore).

      "postMessage": "Yes, there have been previous scams in previous cycles before '21 like BitConnect, but '21 was the true last cycle for mania bull because it coincided with tons of free money entering the economy + gamestop schizo mania. Therefore, everyone went \"ooo ooo ooo I WANNA MAKE MONEY TOO\" and that's why you saw some of the crazy bullruns like you saw with Doge, Shib, Filecoin and a few of the others.This cycle? There's no free money anymore. Literally ALL of the money is flowing to bitcoin and nothing else this time around. Memes are pumping only because of razor thin liquidity and confluencers on X trapping the last desperate normies into their scam traps.Want to know why this cycle is different? Terra Luna, yeah, that fucked a lot of people, as well as Voyager+Celsius, but it's really FTX and the ensuing news cycle drooling about it non-stop. The mainstream media really stamped the message of \"crypto=scam\" to the average normie, so since they got screwed by the bear drop + FTX panic, they're out for good this time.",

If you are a new user, you can instead simply wait 15 minutes before posting. After the wait, you can post threads and replies as normal. If you've been a user of 4chan for more than 15 minutes, the process should be seamless for you. If you are a new 4chan user, then verifying your email address bypasses the wait.You will need to accept 4chan cookies for any of these methods to work. Also, as before, should you choose to verify your email we will not retain long-term records of your email address. After the verification email has been sent, your email address will be purged from our servers.",

Therefore, everyone went \"ooo ooo ooo I WANNA MAKE MONEY TOO\" and that's why you saw some of the crazy bullruns like you saw with Doge, Shib, Filecoin and a few of the others.This cycle? There's no free money anymore. Literally ALL of the money is flowing to bitcoin and nothing else this time around. Memes are pumping only because of razor thin liquidity and confluencers on X trapping the last desperate normies into their scam traps.Want to know why this cycle is different? Terra Luna, yeah, that fucked a lot of people, as well as Voyager+Celsius, but it's really FTX and the ensuing news cycle drooling about it non-stop. The mainstream media really stamped the message of \"crypto=scam\" to the average normie, so since they got screwed by the bear drop + FTX panic, they're out for good this time.",

      "postMessage": "Welcome to the /XMR/ Monero General, dedicated to the discussion of the world's most widely adopted privacy coin.Monero payments are anonymous, low-fee by design and fully fungible, meaning users can send XMR globally without issue and receive XMR without having to worry about tainted coins. Battle-tested privacy tech (Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses and RingCT) ensures that critical TX data cannot be gleaned from the Monero blockchain. Thus by default, the TX history of all Monero users is kept hidden from the prying eyes of adversaries, with TXs being optionally transparent via the aid of a view key.Monero algorithmically ensures low TX fees by employing a dynamic (elastic) block size that can \"stretch\" to easily accommodate sudden TX spikes.Monero's bespoke mining algorithm, RandomX, is optimized for devices using general-purpose CPUs e.g. desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, keeping the barrier to entry low and ASICs out of the equation.Monero's tail emission - 0.6 XMR every block forever - financially incentives for-profit miners to keep mining, helping boost long-term network security. This constant linear inflation asymptotically trends to zero and is offset somewhat by a steady rate of coin loss.Monero has thus far proven to be the only altcoin capable of overcoming BTC's network effect by driving it out of the darknet economy BTC dominated for over 10 years. Monero is now also starting to overtake BTC in clearnet commerce as well. See below.If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.Comment too long.

Holders of ETH on L2 networks looking to stake their ETH must either swap their ETH for wstETH on an exchange and incur slippage, or manually bridge their ETH back to Ethereum mainnet (which may take up to 7 days), stake their ETH in Lido for wstETH, and then manually bridge their wstETH back to the L2 network. >The new Direct Staking rails powered by CCIP compresses all of these steps into a single L2 transaction. >By leveraging CCIP’s Programmable Token Transfers, users can now stake their ETH from Arbitrum, Base, or Optimism and receive wstETH in return in a single transaction. Specifically, Lido’s Direct Staking rails enable multiple different methods of staking ETH from L2 networks, depending on the cost and speed preference of users. These include: >Approach 1: The user stakes on the L2, and then the ETH, along with data instructions on what to do with it, is sent to Ethereum via CCIP. A receiving smart contract within Lido’s Direct Staking rails then stake the ETH in Lido’s staking contracts on Ethereum mainnet and the wstETH is bridged to the user’s wallet address on the L2. >Approach 2: The end user stakes ETH on the L2 to receive wstETH from the liquidity pool. This is achieved by using the exchange rate feed to report the Lido protocol’s internal exchange rate for wstETH on that L2. Once the ETH deposited by the user on the L2 is sent to Ethereum via CCIP along with the instructions to stake, the wstETH is then bridged back to L2 to replenish the pool.",

      "postMessage": "Welcome to the /XMR/ Monero General, dedicated to the discussion of the world's most widely adopted privacy coin.Monero payments are anonymous, low-fee by design and fully fungible, meaning users can send XMR globally without issue and receive XMR without having to worry about tainted coins. Battle-tested privacy tech (Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses and RingCT) ensures that critical TX data cannot be gleaned from the Monero blockchain. Thus by default, the TX history of all Monero users is kept hidden from the prying eyes of adversaries, with TXs being optionally transparent via the aid of a view key.Monero algorithmically ensures low TX fees by employing a dynamic (elastic) block size that can \"stretch\" to easily accommodate sudden TX spikes.Monero's bespoke mining algorithm, RandomX, is optimized for devices using general-purpose CPUs e.g. desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, keeping the barrier to entry low and ASICs out of the equation.Monero's tail emission - 0.6 XMR every block forever - financially incentives for-profit miners to keep mining, helping boost long-term network security. This constant linear inflation asymptotically trends to zero and is offset somewhat by a steady rate of coin loss.Monero has thus far proven to be the only altcoin capable of overcoming BTC's network effect by driving it out of the darknet economy BTC dominated for over 10 years. Monero is now also starting to overtake BTC in clearnet commerce as well. See below.If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.Comment too long.

If you are a new user, you can instead simply wait 15 minutes before posting. After the wait, you can post threads and replies as normal. If you've been a user of 4chan for more than 15 minutes, the process should be seamless for you. If you are a new 4chan user, then verifying your email address bypasses the wait.You will need to accept 4chan cookies for any of these methods to work. Also, as before, should you choose to verify your email we will not retain long-term records of your email address.

She wasn't into it, and then started to distance herself from me which was really fucking brutal because I didn't care THAT much if we dated or not but I did like hanging out with her a lot.Some years later I was able to pattern recognize the guys she dated - total scumbags, classic \"bro\" look, idiots who treated her like shit. Her dad was abusive to her, and I think this all just boiled down to daddy issues.I still get sad thinking about that she'll probably never have a successful relationship. I haven't talked to her in like 15 years because she shut me out. Today she is 40 with no family, as an insurance sales agent. Still pretty hot though.Sometimes I think about reaching out just to say hi but honestly, all women disgust me at this point, even my wife.",

      "postMessage": "Welcome to the /XMR/ Monero General, dedicated to the discussion of the world's most widely adopted privacy coin.Monero payments are anonymous, low-fee by design and fully fungible, meaning users can send XMR globally without issue and receive XMR without having to worry about tainted coins. Battle-tested privacy tech (Ring Signatures, Stealth Addresses and RingCT) ensures that critical TX data cannot be gleaned from the Monero blockchain. Thus by default, the TX history of all Monero users is kept hidden from the prying eyes of adversaries, with TXs being optionally transparent via the aid of a view key.Monero algorithmically ensures low TX fees by employing a dynamic (elastic) block size that can \"stretch\" to easily accommodate sudden TX spikes.Monero's bespoke mining algorithm, RandomX, is optimized for devices using general-purpose CPUs e.g. desktops, laptops, smartphones, tablets, keeping the barrier to entry low and ASICs out of the equation.Monero's tail emission - 0.6 XMR every block forever - financially incentives for-profit miners to keep mining, helping boost long-term network security. This constant linear inflation asymptotically trends to zero and is offset somewhat by a steady rate of coin loss.Monero has thus far proven to be the only altcoin capable of overcoming BTC's network effect by driving it out of the darknet economy BTC dominated for over 10 years. Monero is now also starting to overtake BTC in clearnet commerce as well. See below.If you still have questions, feel free to ask and a MoneroChad will be with you shortly.Comment too long.
